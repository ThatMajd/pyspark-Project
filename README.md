# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project and a machine learning pipeline designed to handle both static and live data. The project includes insightful data visualizations using graphs and explores various data preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for a Random Forest Model. Additionally, the pipeline enables real-time data processing by applying the model to live streamed data.

## Data Analysis

In the data analysis phase, I conducted an in-depth exploration of the dataset to gain valuable insights into the underlying patterns and trends. The analysis includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships among the variables.

- Data visualization using graphs and charts to visualize key aspects of the data.

- Identification and handling of missing or erroneous data points.

- Feature engineering to create meaningful features that enhance model performance.

- Extracted valuable information from the data to drive informed decision-making.

## Machine Learning Pipeline

The machine learning pipeline is designed to process both static and live data, enabling real-time model predictions. The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1\. Data Preprocessing:

Â  Â - Handling missing values using appropriate techniques.

Â  Â - Feature scaling or normalization to ensure uniformity across features.

Â  Â - Encoding categorical variables for compatibility with the model.

2\. Model Training:

Â  Â - Utilizing the preprocessed data to train a Random Forest Model.

Â  Â - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.

3\. Real-time Data Handling:

Â  Â - Building a data stream handler to process live data as it arrives.

Â  Â - Applying the same preprocessing steps on the streaming data as in the training phase.

4\. Real-time Model Prediction:

Â  Â - Utilizing the trained Random Forest Model to make predictions on the live streamed data.

Â  Â - Generating insights and making decisions based on the real-time predictions.
